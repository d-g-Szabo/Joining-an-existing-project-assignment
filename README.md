## Reflection

üéØ Please mention the requirements you met and which goals you achieved for this assignment.

- I met all the requirements, which means I deployed it to Vercel.
- I did fix page titles on post pages to match the post title
- Handled the error when you click to vote while not logged
- Voting was already working as implemented so I did not need to fix that.

üéØ Were there any requirements or goals that you were not quite able to achieve?

- I tried to do Tiptap implementation stretch goal but unfortunately it did not work

üéØ If so, could you please tell us what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?

- Well with the Tiptap I found it hard to understand how I could use the text editor in the form, or how I could access the Tiptap text editors to send it into the database.

(Optional)
üèπ Feel free to add any other reflections you would like to share about your submission e.g.

What went really well and what could have gone better?

- Deploying it was straightforward; I expected actual error, but If one follows the step-by-step tutorial, it's pretty easy.

Requesting feedback about a specific part of your submission.

- Well, I would like to get some insight into how to make Tiptap work with a form.

## Upvote

Upvote is a Reddit-esque web application that allows users to create posts, upvote and downvote posts, and comment on posts in a multi-threaded, nested list.

The project is built using Next.js with the /app router and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and uses [Auth.js (formerly Next Auth)](https://authjs.dev/) for user authentication. The data is stored in a Postgres database, which is created and accessed with raw SQL queries using the `pg` package.

The project is a work in progress and is not yet complete.

## Features

- [x] View a list of posts
- [x] View a single post
- [x] Create a post
- [x] Upvote and downvote posts
- [x] Pagination of posts
- [x] Comment on posts
- [x] Nested comments (recursive lists)
- [x] User authentication

## Setup instructions

1. Fork the repository (check "copy the main branch only") and clone your fork to your local machine
2. Run `npm install`
3. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:
   - `DATABASE_URL` - the URL of your Postgres database (eg. the Supabase connection string)
   - `AUTH_SECRET` - the Next Auth secret string (this can be anything at all like a password, but keep it secret!)
   - `AUTH_GITHUB_ID` - the GitHub OAuth client ID (create yours in [Github developer settings](https://github.com/settings/developers)
   - `AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET` - the GitHub OAuth client secret (create this in [Github developer settings](https://github.com/settings/developers))
4. Create the database schema by running the SQL commands in `schema.sql` in your database (eg. by running the commands in Supabase Query Editor)
5. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
6. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the site
